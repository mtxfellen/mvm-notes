# Cactus' Overclocks for Galvanized Gauntlet
<p></p>
Overclock Upgrades are an attempt to:

- Increase the usage of weapons considered classically
underpowered,
- Allow alternative playstyles for popular weapons.

The specifics of these upgrades are detailed in this document. A maximum of one overclock is allowed per weapon.

<p></p>
At the time of writing, the Archive missions with Overclock Upgrades available are:

- Decay - Diptera Dash (Intermediate)
- Decompose - Ghoulish Genesis (Advanced)
- Legerdemain - Shrouded Shrieks (Advanced)
- Madhattan - Diamond in the Rough (Expert)
- Madhattan - Night Shift (Intermediate)
- Marsbase - Secret Struggle (Advanced)
- Lostvalley - Spine Thief (Intermediate)
- Sequoia - Woodland Pollution (Expert)
- Skeleclipse - Crescent Calamity (Intermediate)
- Swirl Event - Trickster Terror (Advanced)

Weapon stat reference

- <Pos>Up to <b>%s1</b>% increased fire rate as health decreases</Pos>
    - Minimum fire rate is retained at 0.9-1x current maximum HP
    - Maximum fire rate is achieved at 0.2x current maximum HP
    - Fire rate is linearly interpolated between 0.2-0.9x current maximum HP
- <Neg>Up to <b>%s1</b>% reduced accuracy as health decreases</Neg>
    - Minimum bullet spread is retained at 0.9-1x current maximum HP
    - Maximum bullet spread is achieved at 0.2x current maximum HP
    - Bullet spread is linearly interpolated between 0.2-0.9x current maximum HP
- <Pos>On weapon hit: One target at a time is Marked-For-Death for 15s</Pos>
    - Like the Fan-o-war, the duration on this is halved when used vs Giants.
- <Neu>Weapon resistances and vulernability</Neu>
  - Like stock weapons that provide these stats, they do not stack additively with resistances. No immortal babies.

<p></p>
General Notes

- If one somehow manages to have negative cash, upgrades are bugged and will not let you purchase them, even though they cost nothing.
- Clip size decreases do not always apply immediately, meaning upgrades that provide it can be exploited to begin the round with original clip capacity.

## Scout
### Primary

    - <Neg>-46% weapon accuracy</Neg>
    - <Neg>-25% weapon reload speed</Neg>
  - Available on:
    - <Uni>Back Scatter</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - <Pos>Weapon always crits from behind</Pos> does not appear to be as forgiving in angle as the <Uni>Back Scatter's</Uni> default stat <Pos>Mini-crits targets when fired at their back from close range</Pos>, but will of course work from any range.
- Unstable Mod: Special Delivery
    - <Pos>+25 max health on wearer</Pos>
    - <Pos>+46% weapon reload speed</Pos>
    - <Neg>No double jump on wearer</Neg>
    - <Neg>-10% weapon firing speed</Neg>
  - Available on:
    - <Uni>Shortstop</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - <Neg>Increase in push force taken from damage and airblast</Neg> appears to be altered to be provided globally rather than when active.
- Unstable Mod:: Slim Rounds
    - <Pos>+10% weapon damage</Pos>
    - <Pos>+20% weapon accuracy</Pos>
    - <Pos>No weapon knockback on target</Pos>
    - <Neg>No weapon knockback on shooter</Pos>
    - <Neg>-15% weapon reload speed</Neg>
  - Available on:
    - <Uni>Force-a-Nature</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - The additional colon exists in-game.
    - When ghost upgraded with Firing Speed, the knockback removal stat used to occasionally bug; have since been unable to reproduce this behaviour since HH2 and this note will be removed if the bug is not reported any further.
- Unstable Mod: Super Shells
    - <Pos>Hype effect is replaced with mini-crits</Pos>
    - <Neg>-25% weapon reload speed</Neg>
    - <Neg>-50% weapon accuracy</Neg>
  - Available on:
    - <Uni>Soda Popper</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - Effect override uses condition 16, meaning the <Uni>Buff Banner</Uni> will erase Hype effect if the Scout leaves its radius whilst both are active.

### Secondary
- Stable Mod: Combo Bullets
    - <Pos>On weapon kill: Wearer gains Crits for 3s.</Pos>
    - <Pos>+25% weapon damage</Pos>
    - Available on:
        - <Nor>Pistol</Nor>
        - <Uni>Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol</Uni>
        - <Uni>Winger</Uni>
    - Notes:
        - 'AllowPlayerClass Sniper' is provided for this upgrade, but does not target any sniper weapons.
- Unstable Mod: Dairy Mags
    - <Pos>On weapon hit: Apply 2.5s seconds of Mad Milk to target</Pos>
    - <Neg>-75% weapon firing speed</Neg>
    - Available on:
        - <Nor>Pistol</Nor>
        - <Uni>Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol</Uni>
        - <Uni>Winger</Uni>
    - Notes:
        - The <Uni>Mad Milk</Uni> on hit is not additive and only refreshes the duration of the condition.
        - Buying -35% Speed on Target and swapping to this does not work.
- Stable Mod: Battalion's Bonk-up
    - <Neu>Replaces Bonk! Effect with Battalion's Backup effect</Neu>
    - Available on:
        - <Uni>Bonk! Atomic Punch</Uni>
    - Notes:
        - Effect override uses condition 26, meaning the <Uni>Battalion's Backup</Uni> will erase Hype effect if the Scout leaves its radius whilst both are active.
        - Appears to last 10s instead of the expected 8s, though this does not appear to be intended.
- Stable Mod: Hot Knife
    - <Pos>On weapon hit: Target is ignited for 7.5s</Pos>
    - <Pos>On weapon hit: One target at a time is Marked-For-Death for 15s</Pos>
    - <Pos>All players connected via Medigun beams are hit by weapon</Pos>
    - <Neg>-50% weapon bleed damage</Neg>
  - Available on:
    - <Uni>Flying Guillotine</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - The unlisted <Pos>All players connected via Medigun beams are hit</Pos> attribute can prove to be a useful Uber Medic pick tool, as the <Uni>Flying Guillotine</Uni> always does a round 50 base damage, allowing crits to deal up to 150 damage.
    - Ignite is transferred down the medi-chain, causing targets further down the chain to take both their own ignite instance and the ignite damage of targets they are connected to.
      - Recall that the mediguns cause ignite to expire twice as fast.
      - The same rules apply to bleed application.
    - Mark-for-death is applied to whatever target is last in the medi-chain.
    - Given these mechanics, against Giant Medics it makes the most sense to use the <Uni>Flying Guillotine</Uni> on their target for maximum damage to the medic.
    - Against a single target, one cleaver will deal a total of 155 damage.

### Melee
- Unstable Mod: Support Swing
    - <Pos>On weapon hit: One target at a time is Marked-For-Death for 15s</Pos>
    - <Pos>On weapon hit: Apply 6s seconds of Mad Milk to target</Pos>
    - <Neg>-25 max health on wearer</Neg>
    - <Neg>-50% weapon damage</Neg>
    - Available on:
        - <Nor>Bat</Nor>
        - <Uni>Atomizer</Uni>
        - <Uni>Boston Basher</Uni>
        - <Uni>Candy Cane</Uni>
        - <Uni>Holy Mackerel</Uni>
        - <Uni>Sandman</Uni>
        - <Uni>Sun-on-a-Stick</Uni>
        - <Uni>Wrap Assassin</Uni>
    - Notes:
        - Like the <Uni>Sandman's</Uni> default mark upgrade, both the <Uni>Wrap Assassin</Uni> and  <Uni>Sandman</Uni> can mark using their ball with this upgrade.
        - The <Uni>Wrap Assassin</Uni> deals negative melee damage (-9) with this upgrade, causing you to heal your target instead.
- Unstable Mod: Craftsman's Bat
    - <Pos>+15 max health on wearer</Pos>
    - <Pos>On weapon hit: Bleed target for 5s</Pos>
    - <Pos>+300% weapon bleeding damage</Pos>
    - <Neg>-35% swing speed</Pos>
    - Available on:
        - <Uni>Boston Basher</Uni>
        - <Uni>Sandman</Uni>
    - Notes:
        - Bleed damage multiplier also applies to yourself; if you miss with the Boston Basher and aren't buffed, you will die.
        - <Pos>+300% weapon bleeding damage</Pos> is incorrectly listed as '2x bleed damage'
        - `"mult bleeding dmg"` is accidentally defined twice for this upgrade, first at 3 and then at 2; the 4x bleed takes priority.
- Unstable Mod: Sugar Shock
    - <Pos>On weapon hit: One target at a time is Marked-For-Death for 15s</Pos>
    - <Pos>Wearer blast damage vulnerability removed</Pos>
    - <Pos>On weapon hit: Gain a speed boost for 10s</Pos>
    - <Neg>-15 max health on wearer</Neg>
    - Available on:
        - <Uni>Candy Cane</Uni>
    - Notes:
        - <Pos>On weapon hit: Gain a speed boost for 10s</Pos> is unlisted.
- Unstable Mod: Soul Scorcher
    - <Pos>+600% base weapon damage vs burning players</Pos>
    - <Pos>All players connected via Medigun beams are hit by weapon</Pos>
    - <Neg>90% damage penalty vs non-burning players</Neg>
    - Available on:
        - <Uni>Sun-on-a-Stick</Uni>
    - Notes:
        - <Pos>+600% base weapon damage vs burning players</Pos> is incorrectly listed as '6x damage to burning enemies'.
        - Deals 236 damage vs burning targets.
          - (35\*0.75\*3) + 6(35\*0.75) = 236.25
        - Burning target damage bonus is not inherited down the medi-chain; target must be ignited or they will only recieve 3-8 damage.
          - Conversely, the target you hit does not have to be ignited to get the damage bonus down the chain.
- Unstable Mod: Heavy Material
    - <Neu>When weapon is active:</Neu>
      - <Pos>-30% damage from ranged sources</Pos>
      - <Neg>-10% move speed</Neg>
    - Available on:

## Soldier
### Primary
- Unstable Mod: RPG Module
  - <Pos>+25% weapon damage</Pos>
  - <Pos>+35% blast radius</Pos>
  - <Neg>Weapon Clip Size cannot be upgraded</Neg>
  - <Neg>Rockets now fire in an arc</Neg>
  - <Neg>-75% weapon clip size</Neg>
  - <Neg>-75% weapon reload speed</Neg>
  - <Neg>-20% weapon firing speed</Neg>
  - Available on:
    - <Nor>Rocket Launcher</Nor>
    - <Uni>Original</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - Rockets are assigned a -600HUs<sup>-2</sup> vertical acceleration, reducing their effective range from infinite to ~2017HU along flat ground fired at -45°.
    - <Neg>Clip Size cannot be upgraded</Neg> is unlisted.
      - This stat cannot be bypassed by purchasing Clip Size first; you will be unable to take this upgrade if you do.
- Unstable Mod: Extra Gunpowder
  - <Pos>+15% weapon damage</Pos>
  - <Pos>+25% damage to tanks</Pos>
  - <Neg>-20% blast radius</Neg>
  - <Neg>-25% clip size</Neg>
  - Available on:
    - <Uni>Direct Hit</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - Does not seem to outperform the <Uni>Beggar's Bazooka</Uni> at tank busting at any level of credit investment, under both crit and mini-crit conditions; implicitly, then, it would also fail to outperform the <Uni>Air Strike</Uni>.
    - Rocket jumping is still feasible even with an additional <Neg>-20% blast radius</Neg>.
- Unstable Mod: Bionic Box
  - <Pos>On weapon hit: +40 health per enemy hit</Pos>
  - <Pos>+99% firing speed</Pos>
  - <Pos>+10% weapon reload speed</Pos>
  - <Pos>+100% primary reserve ammo</Pos>
  - <Neg>-60% weapon damage</Neg>
  - <Neg>Weapon cannot fire until all rockets are loaded</Neg>
  - <Neg>+3 degrees random weapon projectile deviation</Neg>
  - <Neg>-25% weapon projectile speed</Neg>
  - Available on:
    - <Uni>Black Box</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - <Pos>On weapon hit: +40 health per enemy hit</Pos> works as the old <Uni>Black Box</Uni> attribute, replacing the limited health-on-hit attribute on the current stock variant.
    - Not that you'd need to, but you can't buy more Firing Speed than this weapon provides.
    - This upgrade defines `"heal on hit for rapidfire"` twice, also at +15, but the +40 takes priority.
    - It's possible to tapfire this to not shoot all rockets at once... just about. Not sure why you would want to with <Neg>Cannot fire until all rockets are loaded</Neg>.
      - If you are out of reserve ammo and 3 rockets aren't currently loaded, you will not be able to fire this weapon.
    - jump_sync has never been easier... if you can survive the jump cost. And shit aim.
- Unstable Mod: Tank Buster
  - <Pos>Heal-on-hit stacks vs multiple enemies</Pos>
  - <Pos>+20% weapon damage vs tanks</Pos>
  - <Neg>-25% weapon projectile speed</Neg>
  - Available on:
    - <Uni>Black Box</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - Heal-on-hit is reverted to pre-Gun Mettle behaviour, as on the previous upgrade.
- Unstable Mod: Jump Module
  - <Pos>+40% weapon firing speed</Pos>
  - <Pos>+35% weapon blast radius</Pos>
  - <Pos>+50% primary reserve ammo</Pos>
  - <Neg>-15% weapon damage</Neg>
  - Available on:
    - <Uni>Liberty Launcher</Uni>
- Unstable Mod: Smart Rockets
  - <Pos>0.1x weapon firing delay while blast jumping</Pos>
  - <Neu>Rockets home to crosshair position</Neu>
  - <Neg>-50% weapon clip size</Neg>
  - <Neg>-15% weapon damage</Neg>
  - <Neg>+25% self-damage from blast jumping</Neg>
  - <Neg>-35% weapon projectile speed</Neg>
  - <Neg>Rockets detonate after 2.5s</Neg>
  - Available on:
    - <Uni>Air Strike</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - Rocket turn rate is limited to 360°/s
    - Rocket range is now limited to 2750HU.
    - <Neg>-15% weapon damage</Neg> is unlisted.
    - <Pos>0.1s weapon firing speed while blast jumping</Pos> is incorrectly listed as '+25% increase to rocket jump bonuses'.
      - This is because `"rocketjump attackrate bonus"` is a positive multiplier of the default firing delay, so the real firing interval is about 0.08s.
    - Although the weapon lists '+25% increase to rocket jump *bonuses*', it does not actually apply <Neg>-25% weapon blast radius while blast jumping</Neg>, as this stat applies as a fixed 0.8 radius multiplier.

### Secondary
- Stable Mod: Debuff Rounds
  - <Pos>On weapon hit: One target at a time is Marked-For-Death for 15s</Pos>
  - Available on:
    - <Nor>Shotgun</Nor>
    - <Uni>Panic Attack</Uni>
    - <Uni>Reserve Shooter</Uni>
    - <Uni>Righteous Bison</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - Mark applies to whichever target is hit last with the <Uni>Righteous Bison</Uni>.
    - Shotguns hitting multiple targets appear to select mark target arbitrarily.
      - There's some kind of predictable bullet processing order, though I did not bother to determine this order as it would only be useful information with fixed weapon spread enabled.
- Unstable Mod: Air-raid rounds
  - <Pos>Weapon always crits while blast jumping</Pos>
  - <Pos>0.5x weapon firing delay while blast jumping</Pos>
  - <Pos>+50% weapon accuracy</Pos>
  - <Pos>Provides the B.A.S.E. Jumper to wearer</Pos>
  - <Neg>-50% weapon firing speed</Neg>
  - Available on:
    - <Uni>Reserve Shooter</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - <Pos>+100% weapon firing speed while blast jumping</Pos> is incorrectly listed as 'fires 40% faster while rocket jumping'.
      - Although written wrongly anyway, the significant difference from the stated value is caused by `"rocketjump attackrate bonus"` not being additive with the fire speed penalty on the weapon but rather is a positive multiplier of the base fire delay.
    - <Pos>Provides the B.A.S.E. Jumper to wearer</Pos> is unlisted.
    - <Uni>B.A.S.E. Jumper</Uni> upgrades do not apply if first bought then swapping to this upgrade.
- Stable Mod: Titanium Soles
  - <Pos>+200% credit collection radius on wearer</Pos>
  - <Pos>Wearer never takes falling damage</Pos>
  - <Pos>+25% primary reserve ammo</Pos>
  - <Neg>No weapon stomp damage</Neg>
  - Available on:
    - <Uni>Gunboats</Uni>
    - <Uni>Mantreads</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - <Neg>No stomp damage</Neg> is a side effect of taking no falling damage.
    - <Pos>+200% credit collection radius on wearer</Pos> is half of Scout's radial bonus.
- Unstable Mod: Slim Rockets
  - <Pos>+15% reload speed on wearer</Pos>
  - <Neg>-25 max health on wearer</Neg>
  - Available on:
    - <Uni>B.A.S.E. Jumper</Uni>

    - <Pos>+15% reload speed on wearer</Pos> is incorrectly listed as '+15% faster primary reload'.
- Unstable Mod: Heavy Duty Boots
  - <Pos>+175 stomp damage</Pos>
  - <Pos>+10% move speed on wearer<Pos>
  - Available on:
    - <Uni>Mantreads</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - `"kb fall min velocity" 150 "kb fall radius" 75 "kb fall force" 100 "kb fall stun time" -1` are declared for this upgrade, but do not appear to do anything.
- Stable Mod: Improved Parachute
  - <Pos>200% increased air control on wearer</Pos>

  - <Pos>Weapon projectiles bounce off walls, retaining 80% of speed after each bounce</Pos>
  - <Neg>Weapon projectiles cannot hit the same target multiple times</Neg>
  - <Neg>Clip Size cannot be upgraded</Neg>
  - <Neg>Weapon projectiles now fire in an arc</Neg>
  - <Neg>Weapon projectiles expire after 2s</Neg>
  - Available on:
    - <Uni>Righteous Bison</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - Base damage of 66.
    - Projectile is in function replaced with a Huntsman arrow; its appearance is supposed to be replaced too like the <Uni>Crusader's Crossbow</Uni> to retain an energy theme but appears to currently be bugged.
    - <Neg>Clip Size cannot be upgraded</Neg> is unlisted.
    - Projectile is assigned a -300HUs<sup>-2</sup> vertical acceleration, but due to the short projectile lifetime and ability to bounce, effective range is generally limited by projectile expiration at 2400HU.
    - Projectile appears to retain the 1200HU/s velocity of the <Uni>Righteous Bison</Uni>, along with other properties such as no falloff.

  - <Neg>Airblast no longer pushes back players</Neg>
  - Available on:

  - Notes:
    - The weapon lists <Pos>Slow enemies on hit</Pos>, but it does not appear to do anything on the <Nor>Flamethrower</Nor>.
    - <Pos>Attacks pierce damage resistance effects and bonuses</Pos> is unlisted.
    - <Pos>On Hit: Apply Gas to target</Pos> is incorrectly listed as 'Ignite non-ignitable targets'; in particular, this wording ignores the fact that the <Nor>Flamethrower</Nor> will now always apply a full 10s afterburn.
      - The duration of the gas condition is infinite, but this doesn't particularly matter; the applying hit will trigger it.

    - For whatever reason, <Pos>On weapon hit: Bleed target for 3s</Pos> is only accurate against Giants; regular robots bleed for about 12s. This effect occurs even with no other attributes present on the upgrade. This effect is not reproducible with other weapons that I tested, like the <Uni>Boston Basher</Uni> or <Uni>Pomson 6000</Uni>.

    - The lingering effect of the gas cloud is bugged and does not apply <Uni>Jarate</Uni>, but instead Gas. Enemies will not be inflicted with Gas if they are stood in the initial application radius.

    - Banners are applied as `"add cond on kill" 7450` and `"minicritboost on kill" 5`

    - Rocket turn rate is limited to 360°/s.
    - Naming is inconsistent with other upgrades.
    - Additional ticks of Knockback Rage do not apply more Rocket Specialist ticks.
    - Note that <Neg>Cannot be revved</Neg> means this upgrade will frequently encounter the minigun implicit damage penalty period.
    - This upgrade still inherits the implicit minigun tank damage penalty.
    - Destroy Projectiles predictably does not appear to work well with this upgrade.

    - <Pos>Can be holstered while spinning</Pos> is unlisted.
    - <Pos>+30% damage resistance when below 50% health and spun up</Pos> is listed incorrectly as '+30% Spinup resistance.
    - <Pos>50% critical damage resistance</Pos> seems to be granted as crit damage ignores spinup resistance in TF2.

  - Notes:
    - Uses 2 ticks of Destroy Projectiles; only requires one hit to destroy. Deflection event interval doesn't matter as the <Uni>Family Business</Uni> can't fire that fast.
      - Legitimately using this upgrade for the deflection bonus is a poor choice in any case.

  - Available on:

  - Notes:
    - This upgrade provides conditions 41, 29 and 16. This of course means that the <Uni>Concheror</Uni> will interfere with the buff provided, but also means that the  <Uni>Buff Banner</Uni> will too, as condition 16 is presumably used incorrectly instead of 19.

    - The now total <Neg>-100% maximum overheal</Neg> on this weapon is still subject to the weapon swap bug. Also note that the wording allows Overheal Expert to still apply overheal, and that the reversing the bug to apply a cap on overheal can be exploited for a faster uber build rate.

  - Available on:
    - <Nor>Pistol</Nor>

  - <Pos>On Kill: Gain Mini-crits for 6 seconds.</Pos>

  - <Pos>Wearer never takes falling damage</Pos>
  - <Neg>-10% max metal on wearer</Neg>
  - Available on:
    - <Nor>Wrangler</Nor>
  - Notes:
    - <Neg>-10% max metal</Neg> is listed incorrectly as '-15% less metal'.
    - <Pos>Wearer never takes falling damage</Pos> is unlisted.
- Unstable Mod: Overclocked Circuit
  - <Pos>Primary fire uses explosive bullets</Pos>
  - <Pos>+500% weapon damage</Pos>

  - <Neg>+25% to self blast damage on wearer</Neg>
  - Available on:
    - <Uni>Short Circuit</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - Explosive bullets have a blast radius of 100HU.
    - <Pos>Weapon range increased to 750HU</Pos> is unlisted.
    - <Pos>+500% weapon damage</Pos> is unlisted.
    - <Neg>-35% weapon damage vs players</Neg> is unlisted.
    - <Neg>+25% to self blast damage on wearer</Neg> in unlisted. Note that it applies to sentry rockets.
    - Self blast propulsion appears to be stronger than the <Uni>Detonator</Uni>, whilst dealing less self damage.
      - This means that c-tapping will increase blast jump height.
      - The blast from this weapon is not strong enough to pogo, but it is strong enough to wallclimb.
      - This weapon is hitscan, time your jumps accordingly. This also means that the explosives are effectively centerfired.



### Melee
- Stable Mod: Mobile Processors
  - <Pos>Grants an additional Disposable Sentry</Pos>
  - <Pos>+200% to construction hit boost speed</Pos>
  - <Pos>+200% to dispenser health, ammo and metal output rate</Pos>
  - <Pos>+50% sentry range</Pos>
  - <Pos>Teleporter recharges 50% faster</Pos>
  - <Pos>+200% weapon damage</Pos>
  - Available on:
    - <Uni>Gunslinger</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - <Pos>+200% to construction hit boost speed</Pos> is unlisted.
    - <Pos>+50% sentry range</Pos> is unlisted.
    - <Pos>+200% to dispenser health, ammo and metal output rate</Pos> is incorrectly listed as '+50% more effecient dispenser'.
      - Note that metal is not generated faster, but instead generates and dispenses in 3x quantity. Maximum metal capacity on the dispenser is not increased.
      - Ammo dispenses in 3x quantity, it does not dispense 3x faster.
      - Health is dispensed 3x faster.
    - `"construction rate increased" 2` is declared twice on this upgrade.
    - Since the <Uni>Gunslinger</Uni> deals 195 damage base with this upgrade, it can be used to reliably kill Uber Medics.
- Unstable Mod: Unstable Mechanisms
  - <Neu>When weapon is active:</Neu>
    - <Pos>+35% sentry gun damage</Pos>
    - <Neg>-90% metal recieved</Neg>
  - Available on:
    - <Uni>Southern Hospitality</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - <Neg>-90% metal recieved</Neg> is incorrectly listed as '90% less metal from packs and dispensers'; this is relevant as it also applies to metal regen.
    - Note that the <Uni>Wrangler</Uni> provides higher DPS at any level of Sentry Firing Speed; this upgrade only provides higher single target than the <Uni>Wrangler</Uni> over the duration of a crit canteen.
      - This makes the <Uni>Jag</Uni> perhaps still superior in some rare scenarios for its increased metal refill rate, which synergises better with the <Uni>Wrangler</Uni>.


## Medic
### Primary
- Unstable Mod: Support Bolts
  - <Pos>On weapon hit: Apply 4s seconds of Mad Milk to target</Pos>
  - <Neg>-50% weapon reload speed</Neg>
  - <Neg>-50% weapon damage</Neg>
  - Available on:
    - <Uni>Crusader's Crossbow</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - This has the same base duration as the Mad Milk Syringe's maximum.
- Unstable Mod: Biohazard Needle
  - <Pos>On weapon hit: Apply 3s seconds of Jarate to target</Pos>
  - <Neg>-35% weapon reload speed</Neg>
  - <Neg>-75% weapon clip size</Neg>

  - Available on:
    - <Nor>Syringe Gun</Nor>
    - <Uni>Blutsauger</Uni>
    - <Uni>Overdose</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - The clip size and reload penalty on this upgrade is still sufficient to keep up both <Uni>Jarate</Uni> and <Uni>Mad Milk</Uni> on a single target indefinitely without upgrade.


### Secondary
- Unstable Mod: Broken Shield Lens
  - <Pos>+25 max health on wearer</Pos>
  - <Pos>+25% weapon heal rate</Pos>

  - <Neg>-65% Projectile Shield duration</Neg>
  - Available on:
    - <Nor>Medi Gun</Nor>
    - <Uni>Kritzkrieg</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - This upgrade causes Projectile Shield to heal enemies by 196 over its whole duration.
- Unstable Mod: Prototype Module
  - <Pos>+50% weapon heal rate</Pos>
  - <Pos>Heal buildings at a rate of 40%/s</Pos>
  - <Neg>-50% maximum overheal</Neg>
  - <Neg>-20% ÜberCharge rate on Overhealed patients</Neg>
  - <Neg>-20% overheal duration</Neg>
  - Available on:
    - <Uni>Quick-Fix</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - Overheal Expert allows this medigun to still overheal despite its further 50% overheal penalty.
    - <Neg>-20% overheal duration</Neg> is unlisted.
      - Self-overheal during uber seems to be affected by both this and the overheal penalty, along with Overheal Expert.
    - Uber build rate is roughly equivalent to a non-overhealed player at maximum health against buildings
      - Heal rate against buildings appears to be constant, and also idk how you would ever kill a sentry tanked by a medic with this.

### Melee
- Stable Mod: Battery Leech
  - <Pos>On weapon hit: 15% ÜberCharge added</Pos>
  - Available on:
    - <Nor>Bonesaw</Nor>
    - <Uni>Vita-Saw</Uni>
    - <Uni>Solemn Vow</Uni>
- Stable Mod: Mark Module
  - <Pos>On weapon hit: One target at a time is Marked-For-Death for 15s</Pos>
  - Available on:

  - <Neu>When weapon is active:</Neu>
    - <Neg>-3 health regenerated per second</Neg>
    - <Neg>+20% damage vulnerability</Neg>
  - Available on:
    - <Uni>Amputator</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - This upgrade provides both conditions 26 and 16, which means they will conflict with their respective banners if both this upgrade and banners are active simultaneously.
    - Note that the medic does not recieve the buffs from taunting, but instead on weapon hit, overriding the heal component. Teammates do not receive buffs on hit, only the heal component. This seems to be caused by an oversight in the interaction between `"effect cond override"` and `"aoe heal chance"`.

## Sniper
### Primary
- Unstable Mod: Rifle Mastery
  - <Pos>+20% weapon damage at full charge</Pos>
  - <Pos>+50% rifle charge rate</Pos>
  - <Pos>-40% zoom time</Pos>

    - <Uni>Bazaar Bargain</Uni>
    - <Uni>Classic</Uni>
    - <Uni>Machina</Uni>
    - <Uni>Sydney Sleeper</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - <Pos>-40% zoom time</Pos> is bugged in the same manner as reload speed; it applies only to consecutive re-zooms, so `cl_autorezoom 1` must be set to notice a beneift, or one must hold down right click between shots with `cl_autorezoom 0`.
      - Note that increases to zoom time also cause shots to start charging faster.
- Unstable Mod: Rubber Compound
  - <Pos>+300% weapon bleeding damage</Pos>
  - <Pos>Projectiles home to targets after 3.25s</Pos>
  - <Pos>Projectiles bounce off walls, retaining 95% of their speed after each bounce</Pos>
  - <Neg>No headshots</Neg>
  - <Neg>-35% damage vs players</Neg>
  - <Neg>Projectiles expire after 3.5s</Neg>
  - Available on:
    - <Uni>Huntsman</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - Arrow turn rate is limited to 360°/s.
    - <Pos>Projectiles home to targets after 3.25s</Pos> is incorrectly listed as 'Arrows will seek target after 3 seconds'.
    - <Neg>Projectiles expire after 3.5s</Neg> is unlisted.
- Unstable Mod: Seeker Rounds
  - <Pos>All players connected via Medigun beams are hit by weapon</Pos>
  - <Pos>Can headshot when not fully charged</Pos>
  - <Neg>-90% rifle charge rate</Neg>
  - <Neg>-50% weapon Explosive Headshot damage</Neg>
  - Available on:
    - <Uni>Classic</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - As a specific use case, this could avoid Uber Medics popping when they overheal each other as it applies the base damage of the shot to each, rather than the maximum of 190 on the Explosive Headshot upgrade.

### Secondary
- Stable Mod: Debuff Rounds
  - <Pos>On weapon hit: One target at a time is Marked-For-Death for 15s</Pos>
  - Available on:
    - <Nor>SMG</Nor>
- Unstable Mod: Headshot Mode
  - <Pos>Weapon can headshot</Pos>
  - <Pos>Weapon has increased headshot explosion radius and damage to nearby enemies</Pos>
  - <Neg>-80% weapon Explosive Headshot damage</Neg>
  - <Neg>-50% weapon firing speed</Neg>
  - Available on:
    - <Nor>SMG</Nor>
  - Notes:
    - <Pos>Increased headshot explosion radius and damage to nearby enemies</Pos> is equivalent to one tick of Explosive Headshot.
    - This seems like it would be more useful for its stun ability rather than damage, but note it has only slightly worse DPS vs a single target to a <Uni>Hitman's Heatmaker</Uni> that is focused with 3 ticks of reload speed; it has superior DPS to an unfocus rifle with the same reload speed upgrades.

  - Available on:

  - Notes:
    - Holding fire to reload does not break diguise.
    - This weapon still reloads its entire chamber at once.
- Unstable Mod: Tranq Rounds
  - <Pos>On weapon hit: One target at a time is Marked-For-Death for 15s</Pos>

  - Available on:
    - <Nor>Revolver</Nor>
    - <Uni>Diamondback</Uni>
    - <Uni>L'Etranger</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - Generally this weapon is not much faster at killing multiple sentries than using the <Nor>Revolver</Nor> and shooting at the currently sapped one, one at a time.
    - The <Uni>Red-tape Recorder</Uni> is generally faster at killing sentries with bolstered health than both of these methods.
- Unstable Mod: Explosive Headshot
  - <Pos>Weapon has increased headshot explosion radius and damage to nearby enemies</Pos>
  - <Pos>Critical damage is unaffected by range</Pos>
  - <Neg>-50% weapon reload speed</Neg>
  - <Neg>-20% weapon firing speed</Neg>
  - <Neg>-50% weapon clip size</Neg>
  - Available on:
    - <Uni>Ambassador</Uni>
  - Notes:
    - <Pos>Increased headshot explosion radius and damage to nearby enemies</Pos> is equivalent to one tick of Explosive Headshot.
    - <Neg>-20% weapon firing speed</Neg> is not necessarily a significant downside on the <Uni>Ambassador</Uni>, as it's typically optimal to wait for noth weapon spread and headshot cooldown to reset before firing again anyway.
    - The <Uni>Ambassador</Uni> only deals 102 damage on headshot, so if being used as an Uber Medic picker, it's important to shoot their target in order to deal 150 damage to the pocket.

  - Notes:
    - <Pos>+40 health from collected credits</Pos> is capable of providing uncapped overheal.
    - <Pos>+400% credit collection radius on wearer</Pos> is equivalent to Scout's collection range.
